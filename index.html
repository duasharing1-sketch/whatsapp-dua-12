This powerful dua calls upon Allah — Al-Wadūd, (the Most Loving) — to fill our lives with the love of those whom He Himself loves. It seeks companionship with the sincere and the righteous — those whose love benefits us in this world, and elevates us in the next.

Because who surrounds your heart will shape your path.

“A man is upon the religion of his close friend, so let each of you look at whom he befriends.” — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (Tirmidhi)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Wadud (O Most Loving), grant us the love of all those who sincerely love You, and all those whom You love, within all creation and within all existence in Your knowledge. As well as the love of those whose love would be advantageous for us in Your divine presence.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and from everyone it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
